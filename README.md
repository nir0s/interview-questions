# Interview Questions

This is a list of question I would ask or would like to have been asked for in a job interview for a development or operations role.

The idea is to provide as much background for each question as possible to justify it being asked and to provide blog posts, articles or any other source of information to base it upon.

Some notes:

* Some questions might not be relevant to some people/companies.
* Each question is indicative of something. That certainly does not mean that it fully proves something but rather that it confirms it.
* Asking too many questions exhausts the other side. Make sure you remove unnecessary questions for your pool.

The list comprises of sections, each related to a different area.
